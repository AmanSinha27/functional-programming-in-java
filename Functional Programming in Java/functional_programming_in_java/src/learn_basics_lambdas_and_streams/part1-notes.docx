* Functional programming is less tedious because we don't have to worry about looping over the list
* We are getting the numbers not as a List but as a stream and we can perform any operation on each number of the stream
* Exercises for practice
    * Print all odd numbers from the list
    * Print all courses individually:
        List.of("Spring", "Spring boot", "API", "Microservices", "AWS", "PCF", "Azure", "Docker", "Kubernetes")

    * Print courses containing the word "Spring"
    * Print courses whose name has atleast 4 letters
